## ℹ️ General info

DeepSearch task.

## 🎉 Project Overview

I was tasked with creating a program that, regardless of the size and depth of the objects in the array, would search the entire object against the keyword. If the keyword is found in an object, the entire object is added to the array, which at the very end is returned with all objects containing the keyword.

## 📖 What I learned during this project?

As part of this project, I practiced the application of the concept of recursion and wrote unit tests
